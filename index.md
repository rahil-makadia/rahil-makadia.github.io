Hi there! I'm Rahil Makadia, a planetary defense researcher whose work focuses on developing and improving humanity's strategies to protect Earth from potential asteroid impacts.

I've also had the pleasure of working on a couple of asteroid science missions. I was a member of the science investigation team for the Double Asteroid Redirection Test [(DART)](https://dart.jhuapl.edu/){:target="_blank"} mission and have interned on the [OSIRIS-REx](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/osiris-rex/){:target="_blank"}/[OSIRIS-APEX](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/osiris-apex/){:target="_blank"} mission.

As a graduate student, I was a NASA Space Technology Graduate Research Opportunity ([NSTGRO](https://www.nasa.gov/nasa-space-technology-graduate-research-opportunities-nstgro/){:target="_blank"}) fellow studying Aerospace Engineering in the [APEX Lab](http://apexgroup.web.illinois.edu/){:target="_blank"} at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). My work at UIUC primarily focused on NEO deflection using kinetic impactors. As part of my dissertation, I also developed an open-source software package called the Gauss-Radau Small-body Simulator [(GRSS)](https://rahil-makadia.github.io/grss/){:target="_blank"} that specifically focuses on planetary defense. If you are interested in knowing more about my work, check out the projects at the top of this page (under my name) or <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/cv"> my CV</a>.

In the past I've worked on a variety of projects, including reusable crewed lunar landers (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/pdfs/rascal_2019_report.pdf" target="_blank">report</a>, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/pdfs/rascal_2019_presentation.pdf" target="_blank">presentation</a>, and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/pdfs/rascal_2019_poster.pdf" target="_blank">poster</a>) and habitats for Mars missions (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/pdfs/rascal_2018_report.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/pdfs/rascal_2018_presentation.pdf" target="_blank">presentation</a>) during my undergraduate years. As a graduate student, I have also done work on aerogravity assists using blunt bodies at Venus ([publication](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/375757595/){:target="_blank"}).

Feel free to reach out at any of the links at the bottom of this page (see the round icons) with questions, opportunities, or just to say hi!
