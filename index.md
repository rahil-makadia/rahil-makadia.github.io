Hi there! I'm Rahil Makadia, a graduate student and NASA Space Technology Graduate Research Opportunity (NSTGRO) fellow studying Aerospace Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). My research in the [APEX Lab at UIUC](http://apexgroup.web.illinois.edu/){:target="_blank"} focuses on planetary defense, specifically NEO deflection using kinetic impactors. I've had the pleasure of working on a couple of asteroid science missions. I was a member of the science investigation team for the [Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART)](https://dart.jhuapl.edu/){:target="_blank"} mission and have interned on the [OSIRIS-REx](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/osiris-rex/){:target="_blank"}/[OSIRIS-APEX](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/osiris-apex/){:target="_blank"} mission.

In the past I've worked on a variety of projects, ranging from reusable crewed lunar landers and habitats for Mars missions to aerogravity assists using blunt bodies at Venus.

Feel free to reach out at any of the links at the bottom of this page with questions, opportunities, or just to say hi!
